DDT in a 6m long tube with ridges to increase mixing and initiate detonation. The analysis was done using blastXiFoam solver package developed by Synthetik Technologies LLC. The solver is ideal for compressible premixed/partially-premixed combustion with turbulence modeling. It uses combusting RANS with the b-Xi two-equation model, where Xi is obtained by either the solution or the transport equation for Xi.
